        <h1>Why Andy, why?</h1>
        <p>There are some deliberate choices I made with this site. One of those being the simplistic nature of it. There is almost a lack of style in many places, when there are very complex coding in others. I wanted this website to feel like the most genuine collection of experiences from this life changing trip.</p>
        <p>I did not want any distractions from the content. I wanted it to feel like you were reading our journal and experiencing the plotting of our map. </p>
