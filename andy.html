        <h2>Adirondack Park</h2>
        <p>In May of 2018, my friends and I took a four hour drive up to the Adirondacks. We stopped for a night in Great Sacandaga Lake in fear of an upcoming storm. Thank goodness we did because that night, while we stayed safely in a cabin which belonged to Sophie's family, a huge storm whipped up sand and threw open doors. During the onset of the storm, our bellies were full from a nice dinner we had together and we were outside by the lake when the sand started to fly in our face. It was all of a sudden. We couldn't touch the ground; the wind was so strong. Being on a lake would not have been safe. </p>
        <p>The next day we stopped for groceries and prepared for another 3 hours in the car (two cars) until we reached Saranac. We travelled windy roads through small lake towns, caravan-style with a canoe strapped to each of our cars. Long Lake, Tupper Lake, Lake Pleasant, and Blue Mountain Lake passed us by in mere moments. Soon we reached Saranac and were ready to canoe to our home for the next week, First Island.  </p>
